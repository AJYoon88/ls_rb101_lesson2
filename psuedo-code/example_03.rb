# #a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

# Given an array. 
# set a new empty array.
# Iterate through the given array start from index of 0.
# When the index is odd, pass and move on, when the index is even, including 0, add the element to the new array. 
# print the new array. 



# arr = [given array]
# Set new_arr = []

# iterator = 0

# while iterator <= arr.length
#   if iterator is even
#     new_arr = new_arr + arr[iterator]
#     iterator = iterator + 1
#   else
#     iterator = iterator + 1
#     moveon the the next loop

# print the new_arr
