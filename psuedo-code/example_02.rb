#a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

# Given an array of strings.
# - set a variable with an empty string.
# - iterate through each string, which is added to the variable set above.
# return the variable. 


# Start

# arr = ["str1", "str2", "str3"]

# Set variable = ""

# Set iterator = 0

# While iterator <= length of the arr
#   variable = variable + a string in the arr at the index, which is equal to the iterator. 
#   iterator = iterator + 1
  
# Print variable

# End
